A tool to translate text files, prepared mainly for `srt` translation.

Usage:
`python translate_srt.py`
and you will be prompted for a file name to be translated.

TODO:
- prepare setup for languages;
- include other text files (`txt`, `json`, `vtt` etc);
- automatic input file type recognition;
- automatic input file language recognition.
